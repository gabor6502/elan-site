# Personal Website (React.js, Boostrap, Zustand)

## Branch note
This is a build of the static site intended for github pages. While the backend is being tested and deployed, the contact feature is disabled.
Future (i.e. very soon!) releases will not be using github pages.

## Brief
Development repo for a personal website that acts as a bio/portfolio for myself and facilitates contact requests.

## Tech Stack
- React.js for the core design and interactivity.
- React Boostrap for additional layout support and CSS.
- Zustand for managing state, as project sections retrieves data from a JSON file.
