## Brief
Development repo for a personal website that acts as a bio/portfolio for myself and facilitates contact requeests.

- React.js for the core design and interactivity.
- React Boostrap for additional layout support and CSS.
- Zustand for manaing state, as project sections retrieves data from a JSON file.
