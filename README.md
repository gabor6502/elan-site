# Personal Website (React.js, Boostrap, Zustand)

## Branch note
This is a build of the static site intended for github pages, which was intended as a pre-release demo. It now redirects to the deployed site, just in case there are some users still going through the old github pages link.

You can view the `main` branch instead to see the up to date version, however the production deployment will be in its own private repo to store `.env` and other configurations.

## Brief
Development repo for a personal website that acts as a bio/portfolio for myself and facilitates contact requests.

## Tech Stack
- React.js for the core design and interactivity.
- React Boostrap for additional layout support and CSS.
- Zustand for managing state, as project sections retrieves data from a JSON file.
